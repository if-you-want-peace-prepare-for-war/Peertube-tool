# Changelog

## [1.2.0] - 2025-09-02
### Changed
- Spinner animation for downloads is now plain `-\|/` and does not use colour.
- Download and retry indicators now reuse the same terminal line (no new lines for spinner or retry counter).
- The "Downloading:" message now prints the scrubbed/cleaned URL, not the raw input.
- Various shellcheck compliance improvements throughout the script.
- Version bumped to `1.2.0`.

### Fixed
- Trap-only function `cleanup` is annotated with `# shellcheck disable=SC2317` to silence shellcheck unreachable warnings.
- All user and option parsing is robust and shellcheck-compliant.
